### Translations ###

Hi there! it seems like you are interested in translating ricedroid to your language, unfortunately we don't have enough resources to continue running crowdin to make things much easier to your side, for the mean time, please follow the following steps below on how to contribute translations to ricedroid.

1. Fork the repository you want to translate, name the repository rdtranslations_ + original_repository_name.
   For e.g rdtranslations_android_packages_apps_Settings (so we can track forked repositories that have actual translation changes)

2. Go to values-xxx which holds the strings resources for your language and add entries from values/cr_strings.xml and do your translation edits.
   For reference kindly refer to this link: https://developers.helpshift.com/android/i18n/

3. After editing strings resources, you can leave the forked repository unattended until your translation is pushed to source, we will do the repository tracking and importing for you.
   Changes will be pushed once its verified and does not have any compilation or duplication from source.

Tips/Recommendations:
We recommend using Translator app by sunilpaulmathew for easier importing and translation of strings resources.
